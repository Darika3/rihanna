              Before long Rihanna had signed a contract with DefJam Recordings
              and brought out her debut album, ‘Music of the Sun’ in 2005. It
              debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and sold over two million
              copies worldwide despite receiving only mixed reviews from
              critics. Her second album ‘A Girl Like Me’ was released the next
              year. The album not only became a huge commercial success charting
              in the top ten in 13 countries, but also established the young
              singer as a teenager sensation. It featured the hit single ‘SOS’
              which peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. After enjoying
              more success in the ensuing months, she embarked on the Glow in
              the Dark Tour with Kanye West, Lupe, N.E.R.D, and others in 2008.
              The concert tour travelled to Latin America, Asia, Europe, New
              Zealand and Australia, and received much critical acclaim. In
              2009, her much awaited album ‘Rated R’ was out. She adopted a new
              musical style in this album which was well-received by her fans.
              The album reached No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart and featured
              the single ‘Rude Boy’ which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for
              six weeks. The year 2010 was a very eventful year for her. Her
              album ‘Loud’ went on to become a super-hit prompting the artist to
              embark on the Loud Tour to promote it further. ‘Loud’ spawned
              numerous hits including ‘What's My Name’, ‘Only Girl (In the
              World)’ and ‘S&M’. She also featured on many hits by other
              artists, including Jay-Z's ‘Run this Town’, Eminem's ‘Love the Way
              You Lie’ and Kanye West's ‘All of the Lights’.
